# picocalc-text-starter

This starter kit was created to get you started on the [PicoCalc](https://www.clockworkpi.com/picocalc) using the [Pico-Series C/C++ SDK](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/c_sdk.html). You can recreate the [text-based user interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-based_user_interface) experience of the 1980's that are well suited for a mouseless system.

This starter does not consist of *best-of-bread* drivers for each component. It does provide enough capability to get **your project "started" fast**.


> [!CAUTION]
> You should already have, or will need to gain, knowledge of the Pico-series C/C++ SDK and writing embedded code for the Pico-series devices. You will require a [PicoCalc](https://www.clockworkpi.com/product-page/picocalc) to use these drivers.

This starter includes drivers for:

- Audio (one voice per left/right channel)
- Display (multicolour text with ANSI escape code emulation)
- Keyboard
- Serial port
- SD Card (FAT32 file system only)
- Southbridge functions (keyboard, battery, backlights, power)

See below for more information on integration with the C standard library and the REPL provided to demonstrate the drivers.

> [!WARNING]
> This starter is not designed, nor intended, to create graphical or sprite-based games. Hopefully, other starters are available that can help you, though you could easily create text-based games.

> [!TIP]
> This is a starter project. Feel free to take bits and pieces and modify what is here to suit ***your*** project. The drivers are independent of each other; cherry-pick what you need for your project. 

# Getting Started

Hello, world!

``` C
#include <stdio.h>

// Include driver headers here
#include "drivers/picocalc.h"

int main()
{
    picocalc_init(NULL);

    // Your project starts here
    printf("Hello, world!\n");

    return 0;
}
```


## Configuration

If you are using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) and the [Raspberry Pi Pico](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=raspberry-pi.raspberry-pi-pico) extension, remember to "Switch Board" to the Pico you are using.

> [!TIP]
> Make sure you update `CMakeLists.txt` to set the board to the Pico you are using (PICO_BOARD) and update the WiFi board list at the end of the file if you are using a third-party board. 

**Always use the latest Pico SDK**. This starter is designed to work with the latest Pico SDK. If you are using an older version, you may need to update your SDK or modify the code to work with the older version.


# Standard C Library

By default, this starter routes `stdout` and `stdin` to the display and keyboard. You can use the standard C library functions to print to the display and read from the keyboard. For example:

``` C
#include <stdio.h>
#include "drivers/picocalc.h"

int main()
{
    char buffer[100];

    picocalc_init(NULL);

    printf("Enter your name: ");
    scanf("%99s", buffer);
    printf("Hello, %s!\n", buffer);

    return 0;
}
```

If you want to use standard C library file I/O functions, include `drivers/clib.c` in your project. This will allow you to use `fopen`, `fread`, `fwrite`, and other file I/O functions with the SD card.

``` C
#include <stdio.h>
#include "drivers/picocalc.h"

int main()
{
    picocalc_init(NULL);

    FILE *fp = fopen("/test.txt", "w+");
    if (fp)
    {
        fprintf(fp, "Hello, PicoCalc!\n");
        fclose(fp);
    }
    else
    {
        printf("Failed to open file.\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```


# Starter Demonstration REPL

The main entry point for this starter is a simple REPL to run demos and tests of the drivers and the functioning of your PicoCalc. 

> [!NOTE]
> The REPL is provided only for the demonstration of this library. You will discard and replace the REPL with your project.

## Commands

These commands provide examples of how to use the drivers:

- **backlight** - Displays or sets the backlight values for the display and keyboard
- **battery** – Displays the battery level and status (graphically)
- **beep** – Play a simple beep sound
- **box** – Draws a yellow box using special graphics characters
- **bye** – Reboots the device into BOOTSEL mode
- **cls** – Clears the display
- **cd** – Change the current directory
- **dir** – Display the contents of the current directory
- **free** – Shows the free space remaining on the SD card
- **mkdir** – Create a new directory
- **mkfile** – Create a new file
- **mv** – Move a file or directory
- **more** – Display the contents of a file
- **play** – Play a named song (use 'songs' for a list of available songs)
- **poweroff** – Powers off the device after a delay (requires BIOS 1.4)
- **pwd** – Displays the current directory
- **reset** – Resets the device after a delay (requires BIOS 1.4)
- **rm** – Remove a file
- **rmdir** – Remove a directory
- **sdcard** – Provides information about the inserted SD card
- **songs** – List all available songs
- **test** – Run a named test (use 'tests' for a list of available tests)
- **tests** – List all available tests
- **width** – Set the width of the display
- **help** – Lists the available commands

## Songs

A fun song library is provided to give additional testing the audio driver and hardware.

- **baa** – Baa Baa Black Sheep
- **birthday** – Happy Birthday
- **canon** – Canon in D
- **elise** – Fur Elise
- **macdonald** – Old MacDonald Had a Farm
- **mary** – Mary Had a Little Lamb
- **moonlight** – Moonlight Sonata
- **ode** – Ode to Joy (Beethoven)
- **spider** – Itsy Bitsy Spider
- **twinkle** – Twinkle Twinkle Little Star

## Tests

Tests to make sure the hardware and drivers are working correctly.

- **audio** – Test the audio driver with different notes, distinct left/right separation, melodies bouncing between channels, and harmonious intervals. 
- **display** – Display driver stress test with scrolling lines of different colours, writing ANSI escape codes and characters as quickly as possible. Note: characters processed includes the processing of escape squences where characters displayed are the number of characters drawn on the display.
- **keyboard** – Test the keyboard driver by pressing keys and displaying the key codes. Press 'Brk' to exit the test.
- **lcd** – Basic test of the LCD driver.
- **fat32** – Test the FAT32 driver with different file operations (create, read, write, delete) and verify the integrity of the file system.


# High-Level Drivers

Documentation for the high-level drivers. These drivers use low-level drivers to function.

- [PicoCalc](docs/picocalc.md) – pseudo driver configures the southbridge, display and keyboard drivers
- [Display](docs/display.md) – emulates an ANSI terminal
- [Keyboard](docs/keyboard.md) – uses a timer loop that polls the PicoCalc's southbridge for key presses
- [FAT32](docs/fat32.md) – read and write from an SD card formatted with FAT32


# Low-Level Drivers

Documentation for the low-level drivers. These drivers talk directly to the hardware.

- [Audio](docs/audio.md) – simple audio driver can play stereo notes
- [LCD](docs/lcd.md) – driver for the LCD display that is optimised for displaying text
- [SD Card](docs/sdcard.md) – driver that allows file systems to talk to the SD card
- [Serial](docs/serial.md) – driver for the USB C serial port
- [Southbridge](docs/southbridge.md) – interfaces to the low-speed devices (keyboard, backlight, battery)
